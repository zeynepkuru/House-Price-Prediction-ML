In this project, price information was predicted using machine learning based on the data from the Housing.csv file. The Yes/No columns were converted to 1 or 0 to ensure that the data only contained numerical values. This allowed for the prediction of price information using regression. The 11th column was used as the input data (X), and the price column was used as the output data (y). For regression, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTree, linear regression, and Support Vector Regression from the sklearn library were used.
