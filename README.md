Price information will be estimated using the data in the Housing.csv file. You can import .csv file to Python with Pandas library. You can change the yes/no columns to 1 or 0. In this way, when you make the data contain only numbers, you can predict the price information using other columns using Regression. You should use column 11 as input data (X) and price column as output data (y). For regression, RandomForestRegressor, DecisionTree, linear regression or Support Vector Regression from the sklearn library can be used.
